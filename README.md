## Functionality

For now, it shows pictures from a datebase I created and put markers on new points on a map.

:soon: I will add a functionality that will show pictures from an outsource datebase on markers you will create as well as the address of the marker you created based on Google Maps API

## Comments

Please not that I tried to bypass Instagram API because they have changed their Privacy Policy and just redirect you from markers to my Instagram account using a widget which apparently seems not to work after building the page via GitHub Pages :disappointed:
