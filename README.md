# Pics on a Map

This application allows you to view pictures based on a geolocation and also change Google Maps styles in a side bar options.

## Technologies used

* JavaScript (ES6 standard)
* CSS
* HTML
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* JSON
* Flat UI
* Google Maps API

## Functionality

For now, it shows pictures from a datebase I created and put markers on new points on a map.

Soon, I will add a functionality that will show pictures from an outsource datebase on markers you will create as well as the address of the marker you created based on Google Maps API

## Comments

Please not that I tried to bypass Instagram API because they have changed their Privacy Policy and just redirect you from markers to my Instagram account using a widget which apparently seems not to work after building the page via GitHub Pages :dissapointed:
